# Traveling Fan

#### A web-based reference for post-NFL game sightseeing when traveling to unfamiliar cities.

### Installation Steps

```git clone https://github.com/geet084/traveling-fan.git```

```npm install```

```npm start```

### Background/About

#### This project offered us an introduction to React concepts.  As Turing students, this was our first opportunity to understand the benefits of working with React rather than regular ES6 classes.  Datasets were made by our group members and we were required to make an API fetch from Heroku.  We were also given the opportunity to use Sass/Scss styling and implement a testing suite.

### Primary Technologies Used

- ReactJS
- JSX
- Jest
- Enzyme
- Sass
- Heroku API fetch

### Next Steps
#### Future iterations of the project could include:

- Add team schedule
- Import Leaflet to show map locations for attractions
- Add directions from stadiums to attractions
- CSS transitions between team/city views
- Google displays are in-app rather than in a popup window
